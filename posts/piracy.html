                <h3>A quick tangent</h3>
                <p>
                    Super Mario World is one of my favourite 2D Mario games that Nintendo ever made. Even as a kid I quickly fell in love with the fun soundtrack, the colorful artstyle and fun gameplay. It was also one of the first games I've ever played when my sister first introduced me to video gaming when I was around 3-4 years old. She had all kinds of fun games on her Wii, including some timeless classics like Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Football Strikers and a couple hundret more. I actually still remember askin my sister how she got all of those games, and she showed me something called the "Homebrew Launcher". Naturally 4-year-old YuNii decided to search for it in the iOS App Store once I got home, thinking I could play all of those games for free as well. You can imagine how quickly that hope got crushed. Either way, I've levelled up a couple of times since then, and a few console softmods and a LOT of frustrating moments with streaming services, game publishers and other companies later, I've reached enough of a breaking point to write this article.
                </p>

                <h3>Chapter 1: <i>What the ROM?!</i></h3>

                <p>
                    ROMs are digital copies of video games that can be played on emulators. They are often used to play games on platforms that they were not originally intended for <i>(i.e. playing Super Mario World on a Wii)</i>. There are a plethora of reasons why people use ROMs, for example to play games that are no longer available for purchase, to play games that are region-locked, or to play community translated versions of games only available in other languages. Of course those aren't the only usecases for ROMs, but we'll get to that later. But where do people even get those ROMs? Well, it's not the original developer or publisher of the game, I can tell you that much. Those binaries have been dumped by people all across the world, usually by people who have access to the original game cartridge or disc. The legality of ROMs is a bit of a grey area, as it's not entirely clear if it's legal to download a ROM of a game you own. The general consensus is that it's illegal to download a ROM of a game you don't own, but it's a bit of a different story if you own the game. The problem with this is that it's not always possible to buy a game legally, as some games are no longer available for purchase, or are region-locked. <b>This is where piracy comes into play.</b> People pirate games because they can't buy them legally, or because they don't want to support the developer or publisher of the game. This is a bit of a controversial topic, as some people believe that piracy is wrong, while others believe that it's a form of protest against the current state of the video game industry. I'll get into that later, but for now let's talk about video game preservation.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Chapter 1.1: <i>Video Game Preservation</i></h3>

                <p>
                    Let's be realistic here, how many people do you think currently have a working SNES hooked up to their casual CRT TV in the living room? Not many, I can tell you that much. The problem with old video game consoles is that they are prone to breaking, and once they do, it's often impossible to repair them. This is where video game preservation comes into play. Video game preservation is the act of preserving video games for future generations to enjoy. This can be done by dumping the ROMs of the games, and storing them on a server for people to download.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As mentioned before, video game preservation is not just about keeping old consoles running. It's also about ensuring that the games themselves are still accessible. But what happens when the people who made these games, the publishers and developers, are no longer around, or decide to remove games from storefronts? Well, that's where things get complicated, and licensing becomes a major headache.
                </p>
                
                <br>

                <h3>Chapter 1.2: <i>Publishers and Licensing - Gone but not forgotten?</i></h3>
                
                <p>
                    Imagine you really love a specific game. Let's say, for example, <cite>Driver: San Francisco</cite>. A fantastic game released in 2011 with a gripping storyline, unique gameplay mechanics, and a killer soundtrack.  Now, try to buy it digitally on modern storefronts. Go ahead, I'll wait. You won't find it. Why? Licensing. You see, games like Driver SF often contain licensed music, car models, and other intellectual property. These licenses are not perpetual; they have expiration dates. When those dates pass, renewing them can be costly, and sometimes, publishers simply decide it's not worth the effort anymore.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <cite>Driver: San Francisco</cite> is a prime example.  The game was delisted from digital storefronts in 2016 due to expiring music licenses.  Poof, gone from Steam, PlayStation Store, Xbox Marketplace – you name it.  If you didn't buy it before, you were out of luck in terms of legal digital acquisition. And Driver SF is not alone. Think about countless racing games reliant on car manufacturer licenses, or music games like older Guitar Hero or Rock Band titles, reliant on song licenses. These games become digital ghosts, vanishing from legitimate purchase options simply because the associated licenses expired.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This creates a massive problem for video game preservation. How can we preserve games for future generations if the rights holders themselves are effectively making them disappear?  Physical copies offer a semblance of hope, but even those can degrade over time, and require functioning hardware to play. Furthermore, physical releases often become rare and expensive on the second-hand market, making them inaccessible for many. This digital delisting driven by licensing issues inadvertently creates a stronger justification for the use of ROMs and emulation. If the only way to experience or preserve a piece of gaming history is through unofficial channels, then the demand for these channels naturally increases.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It's a rather ironic situation.  Publishers, in their pursuit of profit and adherence to legal frameworks, inadvertently contribute to the very piracy they often decry. By removing legitimate avenues to access games, especially older ones, they push consumers towards alternative, often less legally clear, methods.
                </p>

                <h3>Chapter 1.3: <i>Currency Conversion - Regional Pricing gone Wrong?</i></h3>
                
                <p>
                    Let's shift gears slightly and talk about another factor pushing people towards the murky waters of ROMs and piracy: currency conversion and regional pricing.  While licensing issues are about games becoming unavailable, currency conversion is about games becoming unaffordable for large portions of the global gaming community.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Video game prices are not universally fixed. Publishers often implement regional pricing strategies, adjusting prices based on the economic conditions of different countries.  In theory, this sounds reasonable – make games more affordable in regions with lower average incomes.  However, in practice, this system can sometimes backfire spectacularly.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Consider countries with weaker currencies compared to the US dollar or Euro.  Due to unfavorable exchange rates, the price of a brand new AAA game, even with regional adjustments, can become prohibitively expensive when converted to the local currency.  Imagine a situation where a standard $60 game in the US translates to a significant portion of a monthly salary in another country.  For many gamers in these regions, purchasing games at these inflated prices is simply not feasible.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This price disparity creates a strong incentive for piracy. When the legitimate purchase price is out of reach, and the allure of gaming is still strong, people are often driven to seek out more affordable alternatives – which often leads them directly to ROM websites and pirated copies.  It's not necessarily about malicious intent, but rather a matter of economic reality.  When faced with the choice between spending a disproportionate amount of their income on a single game or accessing it through less conventional means, many understandably opt for the latter.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is especially relevant in regions where disposable income is lower, and entertainment budgets are tighter.  The perceived value proposition of a game diminishes drastically when its price becomes a significant financial burden.  In such cases, piracy can be seen, not as a moral failing, but as an economic necessity for gamers who simply want to enjoy the same hobby as their counterparts in wealthier nations.  This economic pressure further fuels the demand for ROMs and contributes to the complex ecosystem of video game piracy.
